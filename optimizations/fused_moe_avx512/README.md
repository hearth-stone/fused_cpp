# AVX-512 BF16 fused expert

This optimization implements the synchronous BF16 fused-SiLU expert path for
x86-64 CPUs with AVX-512 BF16. It mirrors the existing ARM/SVE dataflow while
using `VDPBF16PS` and a decode-oriented M12/N32 microkernel.

The fusion boundary and M12 panel loop follow
`csrc/moe/arm/sve_bf16/kernels.S` and the ARM executor. The BF16-pair operand
layout and independent FP32 accumulators were cross-checked against oneDNN's
`src/cpu/x64/gemm/bf16/jit_avx512_core_gemm_bf16bf16f32_kern.cpp` and its copy
kernels under `3rdparty/oneDNN`; this code is an intrinsic implementation, not
copied oneDNN JIT code.

## Supported contract

- dense BF16 `w13=[E, 2F, H]` and `w2=[E, H, F]` weights;
- `activation="silu"`, `fuse_silu=True`, polynomial degree 4, 5, or 6;
- arbitrary positive H/F through zero padding;
- one or two worker threads, top-k routing, weighted merge, output buffers,
  and top-1 `skip_weighted` direct BF16 output;
- no expert bias and no scheduled, async, or vLLM-staged x86 executor yet.

Backend ID 101 and N tile 32 are stored in the prepared-weight metadata.
Runtime dispatch verifies AVX-512F/BW/VL, AVX-512 BF16, and OS-enabled ZMM
state. Set `FUSED_CPP_MOE_AVX512_BF16=0` to disable the backend.

## Packed layouts and dataflow

Weights are packed once by
`prepare_fused_moe_bf16_tiled_weights(..., fuse_silu=True)`. Every packed K
unit contains two adjacent BF16 values consumed by one `VDPBF16PS`:

- W13 uses one 16-feature block at a time; each K pair stores 16 gate pairs
  followed by 16 up pairs;
- W2 uses one 32-output block at a time; each K pair stores 32 BF16 pairs;
- gathered input is grouped into logical M12 panels stored in 16-lane
  VNNI2 packed-A blocks;
- the W13 epilogue writes `SiLU(gate) * up` directly in W2's packed-A layout;
- W2 writes FP32 directly to flat route rows, then an AVX-512 merge produces
  BF16 token output. Top-1 skip-weighted execution writes BF16 directly.

Every full 12-row panel dispatches to the register-resident M12/N32 path, so
M=48 executes four M12 panels. A final 1-11 row panel uses a correct M16-vector
tail fallback. Dedicated M8/M4/M2/M1 tails and the broader scheduled/async API
remain future work, so this backend is still experimental.

Two-thread builds reuse the extension's OpenMP team and fall back to standard
threads when OpenMP is unavailable, nested, or unable to provide the requested
team size. The caller participates as thread zero in the fallback path.

## Build, test, and benchmark

On an x86 host, build only the independent MoE extension when unrelated
architecture-specific sources in the main extension are unavailable:

```bash
MAX_JOBS=2 FUSED_CPP_BUILD_MOE_ONLY=1 \
  .venv/bin/python setup.py build_ext --inplace
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_moe_backend_dispatch.py tests/test_moe_avx512_bf16.py
```

The end-to-end benchmark excludes custom weight prepack from timed execution.
Pin the process and cap oneDNN to the same ISA for a fair AVX-512 comparison:

```bash
ONEDNN_MAX_CPU_ISA=AVX512_CORE_BF16 OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 \
  OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE \
  taskset -c 0,1 env PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python \
  tests/bench_moe_avx512_bf16.py \
  --tokens 16 --hidden 4096 --intermediate 512 \
  --experts 8 --top-k 6 --routing balanced --threads 2
```

Without `ONEDNN_MAX_CPU_ISA`, oneDNN selects AMX on Amazon C8i. That is useful
as a machine-level ceiling but is not an AVX-512 kernel comparison. See
[`results/amazon_c8i_2core_20260718.md`](results/amazon_c8i_2core_20260718.md).

For a lower-overhead oneDNN control, `benchmarks/bench_moe_onednn_avx512.cpp`
uses public oneDNN matmul primitives with `format_tag::any`, reorders both
weights once, reports the selected implementations, and times only W13,
poly5-SiLU/multiply, and W2.
